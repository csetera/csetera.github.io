    <![CDATA[Glad to hear that the posts are of interest to people.  Knowing that makes it worth continuing to to do them.

At the moment, I&#039;ve been keeping the source to myself other than the snippets I&#039;ve posted in the blog entries.  I haven&#039;t really decided what I&#039;m going to do with this project in the long run, so I&#039;m holding on to the code for now.]]>

    <![CDATA[Very nice! I&#039;m newbie with AndEngine so before I see your videos, I was thinking that it will be only possible to build with it some games with regular shapes (defined with 8 vectors maximum). You&#039;ve showed me a new way for futur beautiful and interesting games!
Is your project OpenSource? I mean is it possible to see all the source code?

Anyways, congratulations and good luck!]]>
