    <![CDATA[It looks like it won&#039;t run on my 8330. 

I installed it over the air.  It paused for a moment when I clicked the zberry icon, the nothing. 

Just in case, I even rebooted the bb.   Same result. 

My os version is 4.5.077 verizon, if that helps.]]>

    <![CDATA[I haven&#039;t tried it yet, but I am really happy that you have done this. 

I loved the infocom games and had a lot of them through activision&#039;s lost treasures CD.  

I only 3/4 solved one, but still. 

When I have the time, I&#039;ll install the loader software and then zberry. 
I might be able to find some bugs, and maybe even some criticisms (constructive!).  But writing a patch?  Not a java programmer.  

I hope you continue to work on Zberry.]]>
