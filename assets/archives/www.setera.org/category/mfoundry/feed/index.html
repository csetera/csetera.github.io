    <![CDATA[<p>In general, I prefer to keep this blog focused on interesting (to me) technical topics.  However, as mFoundry continues to grow, I also need to grow my team.  I am looking for a <i>Senior Software Engineer</i> to work with the <i>Product Development</i> team. The ideal candidate would be a seasoned Java engineer interested in mentoring younger engineers. This position is based in Larkspur, CA. </p>
<p>In my mind, mFoundry offers the best balance between the nimbleness of a startup and the stability of a larger company.  The product development team is staffed by experienced, bright, passionate and <b><i>fun</i></b> people to work with.  In all, mFoundry is a great place to work and the product development team is second to none.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know might be interested in a challenging and rewarding job with an excellent company, please take a look at our list of <a href="http://www.mfoundry.com/company/company-careers/">careers page</a> for more information.</p>
