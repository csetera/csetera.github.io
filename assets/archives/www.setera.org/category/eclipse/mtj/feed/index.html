    <![CDATA[<p>When I started hacking on <a href="http://www.eclipseme.org">EclipseME</a> way back in 2001, I never would have guessed that it would still be going in 2012 in use in the form of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mtj/">Eclipse Mobile Tools for Java (MTJ)</a> project and a shipping product.  A few days ago, Gorkem Ercan of Nokia announced that the <a href="http://www.gorkem-ercan.com/2012/06/new-ide-based-on-eclipse-mtj.html">latest version of Nokia SDK for Java is now based on Eclipse MTJ</a>.  Even though I don&#8217;t really spend any time on the MTJ project these days, it is very cool to see the software still being put to good use.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>Given <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/ci.Motorola-CLIQ-US-EN.services">Motorola&#8217;s push into the Android space</a>, it comes as no surprise that they are trimming down the number of developers on the Eclipse Mobile Tools for Java project.  MTJ project lead, Christian Kurzke, <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/dsdp-mtj-dev/msg01352.html">announced via the mailing list</a> that three of the key &#8220;Motorola sponsored&#8221; developers have been reassigned to a different project and will no longer be sponsored to develop the Eclipse MTJ features.  The good news is that Gustavo, Diego and David have expressed interest in continuing to be involved as individual contributors.  In addition, Jon Deardon from Research In Motion will most likely be joining the list of official contributors very soon.</p>
<p>As Christian pointed out via his email, now would be an excellent time to consider getting involved in the Eclipse MTJ project.  Even something as simple as being involved on the mailing list can help us out.  If you are a mobile developer using Eclipse Mobile Tools for Java, consider contributing a patch to provide a cool new feature or to fix the bug that annoys you the most.  Not a developer, but still want to contribute?  We can always use help with documentation and project marketing.  Pitch in and lend a hand!</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>Eric Cloninger of Motorola has started the process of combining Eclipse Mobile Tools for Java, Eclipse Tools for Mobile Linux and Eclipse Pulsar projects under one combined project.  Although the specific name has not been decided yet, a leading candidate is simply the &#8220;Eclipse Mobile Tools&#8221; project.  In Eric&#8217;s <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tml/reviews/MoveReview_DSDP-TmL-MTJ_2009-07-21.pdf">presentation</a> to members of the various projects he mentions a number of compelling reasons for pulling these projects together:<span id="more-167"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The TmL project contains components that are useful on many mobile platforms, not just Linux. As the primary contributor to TmL up to this point, Motorola desires to expand the scope of the project to support other mobile platforms.</li>
<li>The MTJ project contains some components that could be valuable to all mobile developers, not just those who use Java ME.</li>
<li>Code for Eclipse Pulsar was placed in the MTJ repository due to timing issues. Since the Pulsar developers also work on MTJ, it seemed a reasonable location. There is a need for a more suitable and permanent location for this work.</li>
<li>A new project, focused on the needs of all mobile developers has momentum, as previously seen from the excitement around Pulsar. By removing the artificial barriers of “Linux” and “Java”, we hope to provide a home for all Eclipse mobile developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is easy to understand Motorola&#8217;s motivations in making this move, given their transition to the Linux-based Android operating system for many of their upcoming devices.  With that said, I do believe that this move is truly beneficial to the mobile development community.  While developers have to deal with the plethora of mobile device platforms and the associated fragmentation, consumers really only care about the results of development.  The more that the tools can help developers bridge the gaps between the various platforms, the easier it will be to get applications into consumer&#8217;s hand no matter what their device.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is a natural extension to my original goals of making EclipseME support all JavaME devices no matter which vendor provided those devices.  Of course, JavaME&#8217;s role in mobile devices has diminished significantly in recent years, so it makes a lot of sense to broaden the scope to other platforms.  For more information, take a look at the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tml/reviews/MoveReview_DSDP-TmL-MTJ_2009-07-21.pdf">presentation</a> or drop by one of the project mailing lists.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>Along with the <a href="http://eclipse.org/galileo/">Galileo Release of the Eclipse projects</a>, the first early look at the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/pulsar/">Eclipse Pulsar</a> project was released.  The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epp/">Eclipse Packaging Project</a> provides a <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/pulsar-mobile-java-developers/galileor">packaged version of the Pulsar project</a> along with the 1.0 version of the Eclipse Mobile Tools for Java project.</p>
<p><span id="more-130"></span></p>
<p>What the heck is Pulsar?  Pulsar is an effort of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/industry-workgroups/mobilewg.php">Eclipse Mobile Industry Working Group</a>, to make it much easier for mobile developers to download and install the various tools necessary to do mobile development.  In this early release, the project has provided an Eclipse view based on an <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2">Eclipse p2</a> repository.</p>
<div id="attachment_131" style="width: 767px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.setera.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pulsarsdks.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-131" title="Pulsar SDK Selection" src="https://www.setera.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pulsarsdks.png" alt="Pulsar SDK Selection" width="757" height="229" srcset="https://www.setera.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pulsarsdks.png 757w, https://www.setera.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pulsarsdks-300x90.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 757px) 100vw, 757px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pulsar SDK Selection</p></div>
<p>In this early release, Nokia and Motorola have included the necessary p2 artifacts to populate the download and installation view.  It is simply a matter of selecting the SDK of interest and clicking the &#8220;+&#8221; button in the toolbar.  What is really cool about this is that the basis on a p2 repository allows the information in this view to be updated over time as more SDK&#8217;s become available.  Look for more members of the Mobile Industry Working Group to add their SDK&#8217;s to the SDK view in the coming months.  For a guy like me trying to develop for multiple different mobile platforms, this tooling is a huge win.</p>
<p>While the Pulsar tools are great, in some ways, the Mobile Industry Working Group is even more impressive.  Working groups are new to the Eclipse Foundation and the Mobile Industry Working Group is the first.  The group includes members from many of the leading mobile hardware vendors working together to provide a better experience for all mobile developers.  This is a significant change in focus for these vendors versus the earlier siloed approach to mobile tooling.  Just as I work within the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/mtj/">Mobile Tools for Java</a> project to help direct the project to provide hardware-agnostic tooling, I&#8217;m also involved in the Mobile Industry Working Group with the same role.  To be fair, these companies are finally starting to &#8220;get it&#8221; and are working very hard to provide the best possible developer experience.  The understanding of the need for professional developers to target multiple platforms is front and center in these efforts.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>The Eclipse Project has released version 3.5 of the Eclipse platform as part of the Galileo Release Train.  There are announcements and discussions all over the place, like <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Burnette/?p=1276">here</a>, <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/eclipse/fnews/~3/HIZ81R9YCH4/20090624_galileo.php">here</a> and <a href="http://alblue.blogspot.com/2009/06/eclipse-galileo-released.html">here</a>.  The question is where is the love for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/mtj/">Mobile Tools for Java</a>?  The Galileo release marks the graduation of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/mtj/">Mobile Tools for Java</a> project from incubation, providing a solid set of tools for JavaME development in Eclipse.  The involvement from the various member companies has been excellent during the development of MTJ and transition from EclipseME.  I have to admit that I&#8217;m a bit disappointed at the lack of coverage of the release.  Pass the word that MTJ is <em><strong>the</strong></em> way to develop for JavaME.</p>
<p>The Pulsar project also saw an initial early release with Galileo.  I will provide some background on this project in an upcoming post.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>Over on Chris Aniszczyk&#8217;s blog, he <a href="http://aniszczyk.org/2009/06/11/eclipse-galileo-review/">mentions</a> that the Eclipse Mobile Tools for Java and Eclipse Pulsar projects have passed the Galileo release review.  Although Eclipse Mobile Tools for Java isn&#8217;t quite 1.0, it is getting very close.  This is the culmination of the work I started in 2003 on the <a href="https://www.setera.org/projects/eclipseme/">EclipseME project</a>.  When I started that little hobby project, I would not have dreamed that it would have more than 700,000 downloads from Sourceforge or become the base of the official <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/mtj/">Eclipse Mobile Tools for Java</a> project.</p>
<p>Thanks to the help from Motorola and the other members of the Eclipse Mobile Tools for Java project, the EclipseME code has grown and matured far beyond what I could have done in my own free time.   There are many more support options now available and users should find a much smoother environment.  If you need any proof of the commitment from members of the MTJ development team, take a look at the developers <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/dsdp-mtj-dev/msg01203.html">mailing list request</a> to begin work on the first service release beyond MTJ 1.0.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to continuing my involvement with the MTJ project going forward both as a code committer and as a voice for the average mobile developer.  I want to thank all of the users of EclipseME over the years for their continued support and urge you to make the jump to MTJ if you have not already.  The final Galileo release is scheduled to be available on June 24th, but the versions available right now are pretty close to what you can expect at that time.  The differences between this first MTJ version and the last EclipseME release make it a very worthwhile upgrade to your development environment.</p>
