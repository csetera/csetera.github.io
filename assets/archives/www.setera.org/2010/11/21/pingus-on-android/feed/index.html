    <![CDATA[Steve,

Thanks.  I think you were close.  I hadn&#039;t posted again because I was digging into multitouch zoom support.  With zoom to 100% and the ability to drag around the scene, it was clearer that my original hardcoded numbers weren&#039;t quite correct.  Playing around with it a bit, I ended up getting a conversion that actually makes sense and works... a great combination!

    <![CDATA[Hey Craig - so if you are rotating around 0,0 and if that is the top left corner, then if you rotate by 90 degrees in a clockwise direction, the rotation point will now be the top right corner, which may or may not be what you want. In that case you&#039;d have to add (what was) the height to the x position to move the top left of the rotated image to the original location. Just a thought!]]>
